# Simple Logistic Regression Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a simple logistic regression algorithm. The algorithm is designed to perform binary classification tasks by estimating the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class. It is implemented in Python using NumPy and pandas libraries.

## Features

- Implementation of logistic regression from scratch
- Training on simple synthetic datasets
- Application to a real-world dataset for diabetes prediction

## Usage

### Training on Simple Datasets

To train the logistic regression algorithm on simple synthetic datasets, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook `Logestic regression.ipynb`. This notebook demonstrates how the algorithm is implemented and trained on artificially generated datasets with known ground truth.

### Diabetes Prediction

The notebook `Logestic regression.ipynb` demonstrates the application of the logistic regression algorithm to a real-world dataset for diabetes prediction. The dataset contains various physiological measurements of patients, and the task is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on these features.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
